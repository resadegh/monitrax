### Changes Made — Phase WX.5.2: in-widget Wealth Universe navigation
- **Type**: Feature (UX / navigation)
- **Scope**: `WealthUniverseWidget` (dashboard "My Structure" widget)
- **Driver**: Reza 2026-06-11 — *"the widget is still only taking me to the structure page and it has no functionality by itself. Can we have a minimal navigation on the widget as well?"*
- **Solution**: The widget is now a living miniature of the universe with the same microscopic camera as the full canvas:
  - **Bubble tap zooms IN-PLACE** — entities / individuals / groups / clusters with holdings unfold into the focused scene (parent re-centres, satellites ring it) inside the widget itself, via the canonical `layoutWealthExplorer(snapshot, { expandedEntityIds })`. No navigation, no page change.
  - **Camera**: keyed `AnimatePresence` scene swap, scale+opacity only (no animated blur — iOS Safari frame-drops `filter` animations; WX.5.1 lesson applied from the start), snappier 0.5s (the field is small, the journey shorter), `useReducedMotion` → crossfade.
  - **"‹ Universe" back pill** top-left of the mini canvas when zoomed in — mirrors the full canvas's trail-back affordance so the gesture vocabulary is identical.
  - **Tap the bubble you're inside** → zooms back out (same toggle contract as the full canvas).
  - **Asset satellites** and holdings-free entities continue on the full page (`router.push('/dashboard/entities?focus=<layer>')`) — the widget has no detail sheet; leaves hand off to the surface that does.
  - **Header arrow + footer "Open Wealth Universe →"** are now the ONLY full-page navigations, both carrying the current layer as `?focus=` so tap-through reads as "keep zooming", never "start over". Chip + footer totals stay pinned to the universe-level layout (`universeNodes`) so the header numbers never change while zoomed in.
- **Stitch (§18)**: focused-state widget screen generated in project `1859462351962811110` — screen `77b13314b96a4423975b3e89782efa46` ("Wealth Universe · Widget · Focused View"), artefact committed at `.stitch/designs/wealth-universe-zoom/universe-widget-focused-dark.{html,png}`, recorded in `.stitch/metadata.json`. Prompt seeded with the dark-universe vocabulary per §18.7.1; render matches the implementation (back pill, centred protagonist + focal ring, satellite ring, ribbons). The widget is the deliberate dark premium-moment surface, so it ships as a dark variant like the prior `universe-widget-level1-dark`.

### Files Modified
- `components/wealth-explorer/WealthUniverseWidget.tsx` — camera state + `handleTileTap`/`zoomOut`, AnimatePresence scene wrap on the mini canvas, back pill, `WidgetTile` Link→button, header arrow + footer link → `?focus=`-carrying Links, JSDoc updated with the WX.5.2 contract + Stitch SoT.
- `.stitch/designs/wealth-universe-zoom/universe-widget-focused-dark.{html,png}` — new Stitch artefact.
- `.stitch/metadata.json` — screen entry recorded.
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — WX.5.2 appended to the Phase 47 workstream ledger.
