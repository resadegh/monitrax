# Changelog — 2026-05-07

## Session: claude/phase-41i-fixture-contract-corrections (Phase 41i — Audit anomaly triage + JSDoc contract docs)

### Triage outcome
After Phase 41i shipped (PR #671), Reza asked whether the 5 anomalies the audit agent flagged during fixture authoring were real calc errors. Triaged each:

| # | Finding | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `expenseAggregator` frequency conversion | **Not a bug** — engine works with UPPERCASE `Frequency` enum (`'MONTHLY'`); my fixture used lowercase which falls through `toAnnual`'s default branch |
| 2 | `incomeAggregator` frequency + PAYG | **Not a bug** — UPPERCASE enum required + `paygWithholding` is a pre-converted annual figure (asymmetric with `amount`); fixture used wrong contract |
| 3 | `loanAggregator` frequency conversion | **Not a bug** — same UPPERCASE `RepaymentFrequency` enum requirement |
| 4 | `netWorth` MORTGAGE classification | **Not a bug** — engine recognises `'HOME'`/`'INVESTMENT'` (case-insensitive) per app-wide convention, verified in `intelligence/portfolioEngine.ts`, `health/types.ts`, `testing/types.ts`. `'MORTGAGE'` not used as a real loan type anywhere except my fixture |
| 5 | GST `G1` baseline = $12k | **Not a bug** — export GST-free correctly contributes to G1 per BAS rules; my fixture comment was wrong |

**Net: zero engine bugs. All 5 were fixture-authoring errors on my part.** But the audit system did exactly its job — surfaced the gap between my mental model and engine reality.

### Changes
- **Fixture contract corrections** (`lib/calc-audit/engines/core.ts`):
  - `core.netWorth`: replaced `type: 'MORTGAGE'` with `type: 'HOME'` (correct vocabulary). Added new fixture (`Loan with unrecognised type → personal loan`) as a **negative test** that locks in the current classifier behaviour for non-mortgage types.
  - `core.incomeAggregator`: switched to UPPERCASE `'WEEKLY'`/`'ANNUAL'` enum; set `salaryType: 'GROSS'` for SALARY entries; passed PAYG as pre-converted annual ($26k = $500 × 52). Now correctly asserts $109,200 gross / $26,000 PAYG / $104k SALARY breakdown.
  - `core.expenseAggregator`: switched to UPPERCASE `'MONTHLY'`. Now correctly asserts $36,000 annual ($24k housing + $12k food).
  - `core.loanAggregator`: switched to UPPERCASE `'MONTHLY'` + `type: 'HOME'`. Now correctly asserts $30,000/yr ($2,500 × 12).
- **Engine JSDoc contracts**:
  - `lib/calculations/incomeAggregator.ts` — `getGrossAmount` and `getPaygAmount` now document the UPPERCASE enum + PAYG-is-pre-converted-annual contracts
  - `lib/calculations/expenseAggregator.ts` — `aggregateExpenses` documents the UPPERCASE enum contract + warns about silent fall-through bug if violated
  - `lib/calculations/loanAggregator.ts` — `aggregateLoanRepayments` documents the UPPERCASE `RepaymentFrequency` enum
  - `lib/calculations/netWorthCalculator.ts` — `calculateTotalLiabilities` documents the loan-classifier vocabulary (`'HOME'`/`'INVESTMENT'`/`'CREDIT_CARD'`) + cross-references the parallel definitions in `intelligence/portfolioEngine.ts`, `health/types.ts`, `testing/types.ts`
- **18 fixtures → 19 fixtures** (added the negative-test for loan classifier)
- **532 total tests** (unchanged — fixture count grows but the "every fixture passes" test is still 1)
- tsc clean

### Why this matters
This is the second-order win from the calc audit system. By forcing fixtures to use real input contracts (and failing when they don't), the audit caught **5 places where my mental model differed from the engine**. Those gaps now live as JSDoc on the engine helpers, so the next engineer touching this code (human or AI) sees the contract requirement before they hit the same trap.

The audit system also ships a **negative-test fixture** that locks in current "fall-through" behaviour for the loan classifier — any future change to the classifier (tightening the matched types, adding new buckets) will now be caught by the audit.

### Tests
- 532 total (unchanged — but fixture count went from 18 to 19; per-fixture passes are aggregated into a single "every fixture passes" test)
- All audit fixtures green with proper contracts

### Next
**Phase 41h.3** (Practice surface UI for the AI advisor) resumes after this PR merges.

## Session: claude/phase-32c-pr4d-conversations (Phase 32C PR4d — In-app conversations + email-through-app SHIPPED)

### Changes Made
- **Type:** Feature (Demo-Complete Critical Path; closes Up Next #16; closes the relationship loop after PR4c)
- **Scope:** Two-way in-app conversation thread between consumer + professional, mirrored via SendGrid email; auto-created when an adviser accepts a marketplace request; 7yr compliance archive on every message.

### Files Created
- `prisma/migrations/20260507100000_add_conversations/migration.sql` — additive: 5 new `AuditAction` values + 2 new enums (`ConversationRole`, `MessageChannel`) + 3 tables (`professional_conversations` + `conversation_participants` + `conversation_messages`) + indexes + FKs.
- `lib/services/conversationService.ts` — canonical service (~530 lines). `createForAcceptedRequest`, `createOrgScopedConversation`, `assertParticipant`, `listMessages`, `getConversationDetails`, `listConversationsForUser`, `listConversationsForOrg`, `postMessage`, `softDeleteFromUserView`, `closeConversation`, `findConversationByReplyToSlug`, `buildReplyToAddress` re-export, typed-codes `ConversationServiceError`.
- `lib/email/conversationEmail.ts` — zero-dep SendGrid v3 outbound. Activated by `SENDGRID_API_KEY`; falls through to console-log + audit when unset. `buildReplyToAddress` helper. Footer carries reply-to + 7yr disclosure.
- `app/api/conversations/route.ts` — GET list user's conversations + POST ensure-or-create org-scoped conversation (caller-owns-link check).
- `app/api/conversations/[id]/route.ts` — GET detail + POST softDelete / close.
- `app/api/conversations/[id]/messages/route.ts` — GET poll (with `since` + `markAsRead`) + POST send.
- `app/api/conversations/inbound/route.ts` — SendGrid Inbound Parse webhook. Extracts conversation slug from `to` header, verifies sender-email matches consumer participant, posts as EMAIL_IN with channel bypass.
- `app/api/portal/conversations/route.ts` — adviser inbox list (org-scoped).
- `components/conversations/ConversationThread.tsx` — thread component (~300 lines). 5s poll loop, optimistic-add on send with rollback, scroll-to-bottom, ⌘/Ctrl+Enter to send, channel badges, prefers-reduced-motion-aware via Tailwind `motion-safe:*`, 7yr archive disclosure footer with viewer-role-aware copy.
- `app/portal/conversations/page.tsx` — adviser inbox list.
- `app/portal/conversations/[id]/page.tsx` — adviser thread page.
- `app/dashboard/conversations/page.tsx` — user-side list.
- `app/dashboard/conversations/[id]/page.tsx` — user thread page.

### Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `AuditAction` extended with 5 new values (CONVERSATION_CREATED / MESSAGE_SENT / EMAIL_OUTBOUND / EMAIL_INBOUND / SOFT_DELETED_FROM_USER); reverse relations on `User` (conversationParticipations + conversationMessages) + `OrganizationMember` (conversationParticipations) + `Organization` (conversations) + `ProfessionalRequest` (conversation 1-1); 3 new models + 2 new enums appended at end-of-file.
- `lib/services/index.ts` — re-exports the new conversation service surface.
- `lib/services/professionalRequestService.ts` — `acceptRequest` now calls `createForAcceptedRequest` AFTER the inner transaction commits (best-effort; failure doesn't roll back accept). `getRequestForOrg` + `listRequestsForUser` now include `conversation: { id }` so the request detail / tracker can deeplink.
- `app/portal/requests/[id]/page.tsx` — accepted-state card now shows "Open conversation →" alongside "Open client view →".
- `app/dashboard/requests/page.tsx` — accepted-state card surfaces "Open conversation →" deeplink + revised copy ("The conversation is open — keep chatting in-app or by email").
- `components/ask-a-pro/AskAProfessionalDialog.tsx` — `MemberCard` rewritten from placeholder `<Link href="/portal-message?memberId=...">` to `<button>` that calls `POST /api/conversations` ensure-or-create endpoint and routes to `/dashboard/conversations/<id>`. `OrgScopeView` now passes `orgClientId` + `orgName` down to MemberCard so the create call has the auth-gate inputs.
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Up Next #16 marked SHIPPED with summary; new Recently Completed entry prepended for 2026-05-07.
- `docs/pitch/LIGHTHOUSE_ADVISER_PITCH.md` — Step 7 conversation thread demo path populated end-to-end.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Conversation auto-create runs AFTER the accept transaction commits**, not inside. `createForAcceptedRequest` has its own internal transaction; nesting would either error or compromise the consent invariant. Best-effort: a conversation-create failure does NOT roll back accept (the engagement is already in audit + ClientLink); ops can re-run idempotently.
- **`assertParticipant` is the single access-control gate.** Every read/write goes through it; cross-org leakage is structurally impossible because the API can't return a conversation without matching a `ConversationParticipant` row. Mirrors the pattern from PR4c's request access control.
- **Sender role FROZEN at send time.** `senderRole` on `ConversationMessage` is recorded as it was at send time, even if the person later leaves the org. Audit trail stays accurate.
- **Retention column on every message** (not just a global config). Per-tenant retention policy upgrade is a single column edit.
- **Outbound email is fire-and-forget.** The in-app message has already landed before the email send is attempted; SendGrid failures don't surface to the user. PROD wires retries.
- **`replyToSlug` is unguessable + per-conversation.** 32-char hex (16 random bytes). Inbound webhook routes by slug, not by conversation id, so a leaked id can't be used to inject inbound replies into another thread.
- **VIEWER seats excluded from participants.** They can't take inbound (per portal-permissions design); they shouldn't appear in the participant list either.
- **ZERO new dependencies.** SendGrid v3 via raw fetch (no `@sendgrid/mail` package), thread component uses Tailwind `motion-safe:*` utilities (no `framer-motion` import).

### Destructive Write Checklist (CLAUDE.md §12.11)
N/A — additive migration only (CREATE TYPE / CREATE TABLE / ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE). No row mutations on existing tables. The `markAsRead` flow does call `prisma.conversationParticipant.update` — but only on rows the same flow created (the participant row guards by id and role; can't accidentally touch another participant's read state).

### Schema Migration Checklist (CLAUDE.md §12.12)
- [x] `prisma/schema.prisma` modified
- [x] Matching migration at `prisma/migrations/20260507100000_add_conversations/migration.sql`
- [x] Migration is purely additive (no `DROP`, no `ALTER ... DROP COLUMN`, no `TRUNCATE`)
- [x] `npx prisma validate` clean
- [x] `npx prisma generate` clean
