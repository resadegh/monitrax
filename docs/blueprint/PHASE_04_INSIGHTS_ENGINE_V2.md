# 🔮 **PHASE 04 — INSIGHTS ENGINE V2**  
### *Relational intelligence, anomaly detection, and system-wide data interpretation layer.*

---

# **1. Purpose of Phase 04**

Phase 04 transforms Monitrax from a passive calculator into an **intelligent financial reasoning engine**.  
This engine interprets raw data, identifies issues, and produces human-readable insights with recommended actions.

Key goals:

- Detect missing or incorrect relationships
- Generate actionable insights across all modules
- Provide severity-weighted system intelligence
- Feed real-time UI components (Phase 9)
- Become the foundation for the Phase 11 AI Strategy Engine

Insights Engine V2 is the “brain” of Monitrax.

---

# **2. High-Level Responsibilities**

The Insights Engine must:

### **2.1 Interpret Snapshot Data**
- Read the full GRDCS-structured snapshot
- Compare each entity against expected relational rules
- Detect inconsistencies, orphans, missing links, and invalid references

### **2.2 Generate Insights**
Insights must be:

- Severity-weighted (critical, high, medium, low)
- Action-oriented
- Linked to GRDCS entities
- Consistent across all modules
- Fully documented with codes

### **2.3 Provide Summaries & Aggregations**
- Count insights per severity
- Group insights per module
- Provide system-wide health scoring

### **2.4 Feed UI Layers**
Supports:
- Entity insights tab  
- Dashboard insights feed  
- Warning banners  
- Real-time health updates  
- Navigation suggestions  

---

# **3. Insight Categories & Taxonomy**

All insights fall into six major categories:

| Category | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `RELATIONAL` | Missing or invalid GRDCS relationships |
| `COMPLETENESS` | Missing required fields / incomplete data |
| `ANOMALY` | Values that fall outside expected ranges |
| `PERFORMANCE` | Underperforming assets or cashflow |
| `FORECAST` | Negative projections or risk signals |
| `HEALTH` | Snapshot + LinkageHealth combined system score |

Each insight includes:

```
{
  id: string,
  entity: GRDCS,
  severity: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low",
  category: InsightCategory,
  description: string,
  recommendedFix: string,
  linkedEntities?: GRDCS[],
  metadata?: object
}
```

---

# **4. Insight Severity Model**

Severity is determined by combining:

### **4.1 Impact Weight**
How serious the issue is:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Critical | Causes financial loss or breaks system logic |
| High | Strongly impacts accuracy or cashflow |
| Medium | Missing data reduces precision |
| Low | Advisory or optimisation improvement |

### **4.2 Confidence Weight**
How confident the engine is in this finding.

### **4.3 Persistence**
Severity grows if:
- Issue persists across multiple snapshots  
- Issue affects multiple modules  
- Dependencies are affected  

Formula:

```
severityScore = impactWeight * confidenceWeight * persistenceFactor
```

---

# **5. Insight Generation Pipelines**

Insights Engine V2 includes **six pipelines**, executed in this order:

---

## **5.1 Relational Integrity Pipeline**

Checks relational rules defined in GRDCS:

- Missing parent (e.g., holding without account)
- Missing reverse link (e.g., property exists but loan does not reference it)
- Orphan entities
- Invalid references (IDs that don’t exist in snapshot)
- Broken cascades (e.g., investment → holding → transaction)

Produces insights like:

```
"Investment Holding 'ABC' is missing its parent investment account."
"Loan L002 references a property that no longer exists."
```

---

## **5.2 Completeness Pipeline**

Checks for missing required data:

- Loan missing interest rate
- Property missing purchase price
- Expense missing category
- Income missing frequency
- Holding missing ticker

---

## **5.3 Anomaly Pipeline**

Detects “mathematically suspicious” data:

- Expenses that exceed income (sustained)
- Negative values where not allowed
- Unrealistically high yields
- Transaction amounts inconsistent with holdings

---

## **5.4 Performance Pipeline**

Evaluates financial performance:

- Underperforming holdings  
- Negative rental performance  
- Poor cashflow properties  
- Declining investment accounts  

Uses:

- Yield  
- IRR (when available)  
- Growth rate  
- Depreciation efficiency  

---

## **5.5 Forecast Pipeline**

Uses Phase 3 projection engines:

- Upcoming negative cashflow
- Balloon repayments  
- Increasing expenses  
- Expiring fixed rates  
- Tax impact signals  

---

## **5.6 Health Fusion Pipeline**

Combines:

- LinkageHealth score  
- Snapshot completeness  
- Insight severity distribution  

Outputs:

```
{
  completenessScore: number,
  orphanCount: number,
  missingLinks: number,
  crossModuleConsistency: number,
  overallHealth: "healthy" | "warning" | "high" | "critical"
}
```

This feeds the **Global Health Indicator** (Phase 9).

---

# **6. Entity-Level Insight Attachment**

Each entity receives:

```
entity.insights = InsightItem[]
entity.health = EntityHealthSummary
```

EntityHealthSummary:

```
{
  severity: "healthy" | "warning" | "high" | "critical",
  issues: InsightItem[]
}
```

Used by:
- Entity detail dialog  
- Insight tab  
- Warning banners  

---

# **7. Module-Level Insight Aggregation**

Per-module summaries:

```
{
  module: "properties" | "loans" | ...,
  insightCount: number,
  critical: number,
  high: number,
  medium: number,
  low: number,
  topInsights: InsightItem[]
}
```

Used by:
- Dashboard module preview  
- ModuleInsightsPanel  

---

# **8. Global System Summary**

Generated at the end of the pipeline:

```
{
  summary: {
    totalCount,
    critical,
    high,
    medium,
    low
  },
  byModule,
  byCategory
}
```

This feeds:
- DashboardInsightsFeed  
- HealthSummaryWidget  

---

# **9. Integration with Snapshot Engine**

Snapshot Engine must:

- Invoke insights engine every time snapshot is produced  
- Attach insights to result payload  
- Expose insights at `/api/portfolio/snapshot`  

Output shape:

```
{
  snapshot: {...},
  insights: InsightsResult,
  health: HealthSummary
}
```

No secondary API required.

---

# **10. UI Integration Points**

Insights Engine V2 directly powers:

### **10.1 Entity Insights Tab**
- Tab in all detail dialogs

### **10.2 Dashboard Insights Feed**
- Grouped by severity  
- Shows critical + high alerts first  

### **10.3 Module Insights Panel**
- Each module’s top 3 issues  

### **10.4 Warning Banners**
- Critical and high issues displayed globally  

### **10.5 Real-Time Sync Engine**
- Recalculates insights every 15s in the UI  

---

# **11. Performance Requirements**

- Must compute insights for < 10,000 entities in under 200ms
- High-severity insights must be available in < 100ms
- Recalculation must be deterministic
- Snapshot + insights combined result must be stable and reproducible
